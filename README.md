**Idea**
```
Developed in the 1980’s by a group of Quants at Morgan Stanley, who reportedly made over $50 million profit for the firm in 1987
A contrarian strategy that tries to profit from the principles of mean-reversion processes
In theory, one could expand the strategy to include a basket of more than a pair of related stocks 
```

**The Hypothesis**
```
This experiment will test the following hypotheses:

 - Choose a pair of stocks that move together very closely, based on a certain criteria (i.e. Coke & Pepsi)
 - Wait until the prices diverge beyond a certain threshold, then short the “winner” and buy the “loser”
 - Reverse your positions when the two prices converge --> Profit from the reversal in trend
```

**Invester Decision**
```
- Pair Selection Criteria
  - Correlation (Parametric & Non-Parametric Spearman’s Rho)
  - Dickey-Fuller Test Statistic (Cointegration)
- Trading Threshold (areas of consideration)
  - Volatility of the Market
  - Historical returns
  - Cost of each transaction
```
